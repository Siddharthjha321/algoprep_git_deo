## Term
**Repository (Repo):**
A storage location for your project ,including all the files and the entire history of their changes.

**staging area** -> tracked changes
**working directory** -> untracked changes



# git workflow
* git init -> wherever you enter git init an empty git repository is created (tracker without any history)
* git add -> added to staging area(snapshot of the code is added)

* `.gitignore` : this the file where you can put the files and folder name which you don't want to be tracked 
* `git add .` -> to send all the files current snapshot to staging area
