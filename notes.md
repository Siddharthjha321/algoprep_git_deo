# how git stores the changes
* git has three areas -> working directory -> current changes
* Intermediate layer -> staging



## Term
**Repository (Repo):**
A storage location for your project ,including all the files and the entire history of their changes.

**staging area** -> tracked changes
**working directory** -> untracked changes



# git workflow
* git init -> wherever you enter git init an empty git repository is created (tracker without any history)
* git add -> added to staging area(snapshot of the code is added)

* `.gitignore` : this the file where you can put the files and folder name which you don't want to be tracked 
* `git add .` -> to send all the files current snapshot to staging area
* `git add .` -> to send all the files current snapshot to staging area
* `git commit -m` : A snapshot of changes made to the repository.each commit has a unique ID and a message describing the changes
* `git log`: list of commits
* `git checkout commit-hash` : you can view how codelooked like in a particular commit
* to go back to latest commit -> `HEAD` 
  * type git branch -> check your branch name
  * `git checkout branch-name`
